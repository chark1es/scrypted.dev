			<p class="tag-pill">Privacy Policy</p>
			<h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-black md:text-4xl">How Scrypted handles your data</h1>
			<p class="text-black/75">
				This overview explains what personal information is collected across the entire Scrypted studio—spanning current and future experimental apps—why we keep it, and how you can control or remove it while testing prototypes.
			</p>
		</header>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">1. Information we collect</h2>
			<ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-black/80">
				<li><strong>Identity:</strong> Google email, name, and identifiers supplied via Logto sign-in.</li>
				<li><strong>Usage:</strong> Data you create inside each app (documents, tasks, telemetry), plus anonymized diagnostics and crash logs.</li>
				<li><strong>Support:</strong> Messages or artifacts you send when requesting access, giving feedback, or reporting bugs.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">2. How we use that data</h2>
			<p>
				Information stays inside Scrypted. It's used to authenticate you, operate the apps you're testing, troubleshoot issues, and reach out when a new build is ready. Data is never sold or shared with third parties, and optional analytics (when enabled) stay aggregate and anonymous.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">3. Storage, security, and retention</h2>
			<p>
				Convex hosts application data in US regions with built-in encryption at rest and in transit. We maintain backups for disaster recovery; when data is deleted, it leaves live systems immediately and rolls out of backups on their normal schedule. Because these are experimental tools, unexpected resets or data loss can still occur—please export anything important.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">4. Your controls & deletion</h2>
			<p>
				Email <a class="underline decoration-black/30 underline-offset-4" href="mailto:hello@scrypted.dev">hello@scrypted.dev</a> to review or delete your data. We confirm ownership, remove the Logto account, and purge associated Convex records within a reasonable timeframe. If we can't fulfill a request (for example, because the data is in an active investigation), we'll explain why.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">5. Third-party processors</h2>
			<p>
				Scrypted relies on Convex (data storage), Logto (authentication), and Cloudflare (edge/routing). Those vendors process your information strictly to provide infrastructure services to us and are bound by their own security programs. Using any Scrypted app means your data may flow through these providers for the purposes described above.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">6. Children</h2>
			<p>
				Scrypted is not directed at people under 18. If we learn a minor has accessed the platform, we delete their data immediately and block access.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">7. Changes</h2>
			<p>
				We revise this policy as infrastructure evolves. We'll post the revision date here and highlight material updates in-app or via email. Continuing to use Scrypted after a change means you accept the latest version.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">8. Contact</h2>

				Need help with privacy or data rights for a specific Scrypted app? Email <a class="underline decoration-black/30 underline-offset-4" href="mailto:hello@scrypted.dev">hello@scrypted.dev</a> with the product name and we'll respond as soon as possible.

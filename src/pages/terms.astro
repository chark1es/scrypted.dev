			<p class="tag-pill">Terms of Service</p>
			<h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-black md:text-4xl">How to use Scrypted</h1>
			<p class="text-black/75">
				Scrypted operates as a small studio shipping multiple experimental apps and utilities. Accessing any Scrypted-branded experience means you agree to play nice, respect the people testing alongside you, and understand that everything is experimental.
			</p>
		</header>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">1. Accounts & Authentication</h2>
			<p>
				Authentication runs through Logto with Convex providing the data layer. Signing in with Google shares your email, display name, and identity tokens so we can authorize you across apps. Accounts are issued manually. To close yours, email
				<a class="underline decoration-black/30 underline-offset-4" href="mailto:hello@scrypted.dev">hello@scrypted.dev</a> and we will remove it (including data in connected apps) as quickly as possible.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">2. Acceptable Use & Conduct</h2>
			<ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-black/80">
				<li>Don't resell, redistribute, or publicly demo Scrypted tools without permission.</li>
				<li>Don't try to bypass authentication, scrape data, brute-force APIs, or disable safeguards.</li>
				<li>Don't push unlawful, hateful, or harmful content through any prototype.</li>
				<li>Report security issues privately—responsible disclosure beats tweeting a bug.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">3. Experimental Products</h2>
			<p>
				Features ship, break, and disappear without notice. Data may reset. Back up anything important because we can't promise redundancy beyond the basics. By continuing to use Scrypted, you accept this instability.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">4. Privacy & Data Sharing</h2>
			<p>
				We only collect the minimum personal information required to authenticate you and run the specific tool you're testing. Data is never sold or shared with third parties. The companion
				<a class="underline decoration-black/30 underline-offset-4" href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> explains the details.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">5. Liability & Warranties</h2>
			<p>
				Scrypted is provided "as is" with no express or implied warranties. To the fullest extent allowed by law, we disclaim responsibility for lost data, downtime, indirect damages, or the consequences of relying on unfinished software. Tell us when something breaks so we can patch it.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">6. Termination</h2>
			<p>
				Access can be revoked at any time if an account goes quiet for too long, abuses resources, or violates these terms. We'll try to notify you before removing access unless urgent action is required.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">7. Updates</h2>
			<p>
				These terms evolve with the platform. Material changes will be announced in-app or via email. Continuing to use Scrypted after an update means you accept the latest version. The revision date will always be posted at the top of this page.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">8. Covered apps & experiments</h2>
			<p>
				These terms apply to every Scrypted project, present or future. Features, pricing (if any), and access rules may differ per app, but behavior standards, privacy expectations, and account controls remain the same. If an app lists additional rules, you must follow those alongside this document.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">9. Third-party services</h2>
			<p>
				Scrypted relies on third-party infrastructure providers such as Convex (data), Logto (authentication), and Cloudflare (routing/edge). Using Scrypted means agreeing to their platform terms as they apply to your account. Outages or policy changes originating from those vendors are outside our control, and access may be paused while we adapt.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="space-y-3">
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">10. Contact</h2>
			<p>
				Questions about these terms or any Scrypted app? Email <a class="underline decoration-black/30 underline-offset-4" href="mailto:hello@scrypted.dev">hello@scrypted.dev</a> with the product name so we can route the request quickly.
